## üöÄ Features

- **Easy Configuration Switching**: Seamlessly switch between Z.ai, Anthropic Claude, and custom API endpoints
- **Persistent Storage**: Securely saves your API keys locally for convenience
- **Real-time Status Display**: Shows your current configuration at a glance
- **Automatic Detection**: Detects and pre-fills existing environment variables

## üîí Security Features

- **Local Storage**: API keys are stored locally in `~/.claude_ez_switch/config.json`
- **Secure Environment Variables**: Uses Windows user-level environment variables
- **No Cloud Storage**: No data is sent to external servers

## üìã Prerequisites

Before installing Claude Code EZ Switch, ensure you have the following:

- **Python**: Version 3.7 or higher
- **Operating System**: Windows 10 or above
- **Claude Code CLI**: The command-line interface version of Claude Code

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

1. **Clone or download this repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/techcow2/claude-code-ez-switch.git
   cd claude-code-ez-switch
   ```

2. **Run the application**:
   ```bash
   python ezswitch.py
   ```

No additional packages need to be installed - all dependencies are included with standard Python installations!

## üéØ How to Use

### 1. Launch the Application
Simply run `ezswitch.py` to open the configuration manager.

### 2. Choose Your Configuration

#### **Z.ai Configuration**
- Select "Z.ai" radio button
- Enter your Z.ai API key
- Click "Apply Configuration"

#### **Anthropic Claude Configuration**
- Select "Anthropic" radio button
- Choose between:
  - **Subscription Mode**: Use your Claude Pro/Team/Enterprise subscription
  - **API Key Mode**: Enter your Claude API key
- Click "Apply Configuration"

#### **Custom Configuration**
- Select "Custom" radio button
- Enter your custom base URL (e.g., `https://your-api-endpoint.com`)
- Enter your custom API key
- Click "Apply Configuration"

### 3. Apply Changes
After clicking "Apply Configuration":
- The application will set the necessary environment variables
- **üî¥ CRITICAL**: You must close **ALL** applications running Claude Code, including:
  - VS Code (if running Claude Code in the VS Code terminal)
  - VS Code with Claude Code extension
  - Claude Code CLI in PowerShell terminals
  - Claude Code CLI in Command Prompt terminals
  - Any other applications using Claude Code
- Then reopen these applications for changes to take effect
- **Important**: The API configuration loaded in this app will reflect for both the CLI version and VS Code extension of Claude Code
- Environment variables are only read when applications first start

### 4. Special Login Requirements
**When switching to Anthropic configuration from another configuration:**
- After reopening Claude Code CLI, you must log back into your Anthropic account
- Run the command: `/login`
- This is required because switching from other endpoints clears your authentication session

### 5. Verify Configuration
Use the "Refresh" button to check your current configuration status at any time.

## üîß Configuration Details

The application manages the following Windows user environment variables that are used by **both Claude Code CLI and Claude Code VS Code extension**:

- `ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN`: Your API authentication token
- `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL`: The API base URL (if applicable)

**Note**: The API configuration set by this application will be used by both the CLI version and the VS Code extension of Claude Code, as they both read from the same environment variables.

### Configuration Examples:

**Z.ai**:
- `ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN`: Your Z.ai API key
- `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL`: `https://api.z.ai/api/anthropic`

**Claude API**:
- `ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN`: Your Claude API key
- `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL`: Not set (uses default)

**Custom**:
- `ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN`: Your custom API key
- `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL`: Your custom endpoint URL

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **"This application is designed for Windows only"**
   - This app only works on Windows due to PowerShell environment variable management

2. **Configuration not taking effect**
   - **CRITICAL**: Make sure you have closed ALL applications using Claude Code (VS Code with Claude Code extension, Claude Code CLI in PowerShell, Claude Code CLI in Command Prompt, etc.) before reopening them
   - Environment variables are only loaded when applications start, not dynamically
   - Check that your application reads user-level environment variables
   - Remember that both Claude Code CLI and VS Code extension use the same environment variables set by this application

3. **Authentication issues when switching to Anthropic**
   - After switching to Anthropic configuration, you must run `claude code /login` in the CLI
   - This is required because switching from other endpoints clears your authentication session
   - Make sure you're logged into the correct Anthropic account

4. **API keys not saving**
   - Ensure the application has write permissions to your user home directory
   - Check for the config directory at `%USERPROFILE%\.claude_ez_switch\`
   - The config file should be located at `%USERPROFILE%\.claude_ez_switch\config.json`

5. **PowerShell command failures**
   - Run the application as Administrator if you encounter permission issues
   - Ensure PowerShell execution policy allows running scripts
