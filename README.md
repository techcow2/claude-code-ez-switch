   ```

No additional packages need to be installed - all dependencies are included with standard Python installations!

## üéØ How to Use

### 1. Launch the Application
Simply run `ezswitch.py` to open the configuration manager.

### 2. Choose Your Configuration

#### **Z.ai Configuration**
- Select "Z.ai" radio button
- Enter your Z.ai API key
- Click "Apply Configuration"

#### **Anthropic Claude Configuration**
- Select "Anthropic" radio button
- Choose between:
  - **Subscription Mode**: Use your Claude Pro/Team/Enterprise subscription
  - **API Key Mode**: Enter your Claude API key
- Click "Apply Configuration"

#### **Custom Configuration**
- Select "Custom" radio button
- Enter your custom base URL (e.g., `https://your-api-endpoint.com`)
- Enter your custom API key
- Click "Apply Configuration"

### 3. Apply Changes
After clicking "Apply Configuration":
- The application will set the necessary environment variables
- **üî¥ CRITICAL**: You must close **ALL** applications running Claude Code, including:
  - VS Code (if running Claude Code in the VS Code terminal)
  - PowerShell terminals
  - Command Prompt terminals
  - Any other applications using Claude Code
- Then reopen these applications for changes to take effect
- Environment variables are only read when applications first start

### 4. Special Login Requirements
**When switching to Anthropic configuration from another configuration:**
- After reopening Claude Code CLI, you must log back into your Anthropic account
- Run the command: `/login`
- This is required because switching from other endpoints clears your authentication session

### 5. Verify Configuration
Use the "Refresh" button to check your current configuration status at any time.

## üîß Configuration Details

The application manages the following Windows user environment variables:

- `ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN`: Your API authentication token
- `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL`: The API base URL (if applicable)

### Configuration Examples:

**Z.ai**:
- `ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN`: Your Z.ai API key
- `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL`: `https://api.z.ai/api/anthropic`

**Claude API**:
- `ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN`: Your Claude API key
- `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL`: Not set (uses default)

**Custom**:
- `ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN`: Your custom API key
- `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL`: Your custom endpoint URL

## üîí Security Features

- **Local Storage**: API keys are stored locally in `~/.claude_code_ez_switch_config.json`
- **Password Masking**: API keys are hidden by default with asterisks
- **Secure Environment Variables**: Uses Windows user-level environment variables
- **No Cloud Storage**: No data is sent to external servers

## üé® Interface Features

- **Dark Theme**: Easy on the eyes with professional dark color scheme
- **Status Display**: Real-time configuration status with masked API keys
- **Loading Indicators**: Visual feedback during configuration changes
- **Hover Effects**: Interactive buttons with smooth transitions
- **Responsive Layout**: Clean, organized interface with proper spacing

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **"This application is designed for Windows only"**
   - This app only works on Windows due to PowerShell environment variable management

2. **Configuration not taking effect**
   - **CRITICAL**: Make sure you have closed ALL applications using Claude Code (VS Code, PowerShell, Command Prompt, etc.) before reopening them
   - Environment variables are only loaded when applications start, not dynamically
   - Check that your application reads user-level environment variables

3. **Authentication issues when switching to Anthropic**
   - After switching to Anthropic configuration, you must run `claude code /login` in the CLI
   - This is required because switching from other endpoints clears your authentication session
   - Make sure you're logged into the correct Anthropic account

4. **API keys not saving**
   - Ensure the application has write permissions to your user home directory
   - Check for the config file at `%USERPROFILE%\.claude_code_ez_switch_config.json`

5. **PowerShell command failures**
   - Run the application as Administrator if you encounter permission issues
   - Ensure PowerShell execution policy allows running scripts
